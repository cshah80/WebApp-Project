        <h2 class="section-title">Hi, I'm Chirag!</h2>
        <p>
            I am an incredibly kind-hearted and generous individual. I have a magnetic personality and always seem to 
            bring positivity to any situation. I have a thirst for knowledge and am constantly seeking new information to 
            expand my understanding of the world. I have been told that I am great listener and an empathetic friend, always 
            willing to lend an ear and offer support. My enthusiasm for life is contagious, and I have a talent for making 
            those around me feel uplifted and appreciated. Overall, I am an exceptional person who most would feel lucky to 
            have in their life as a friend.  Also, Cyber Security is great!

                <h3>Ransomware, Great Scott!</h3>
                <h4>ransomware</h4>
                <p>What's so bad about ransomware?  Is it really as bad as you've been lead to believe?  Turns out, you were not 
                   lied to.  It might even be worse than your worst nightmare.  Ransomware is bad, outright malicious; 
                   it's designed to cause harm to individuals and organizations by encrypting their files and demanding payment in
                   exchange for a decryption key.  Ransomware attacks can result in a significant loss of critical data, damage
                   to computer systems, and disruptions to business operations. If you still have uncontrollable urges to click on 
                   unsolicited links from unknown sources, don't try to resist too much.  Your friendly neighborhood cyber security
                   professional will get you out of any trouble you get into.

                <h3>Cryptography, You're the Best, Around!</h3>
                <h4>cryptography</h4>
                <p>
                    You like secrets?  Who doesn't?  How do you keep your information private, safe from the spies all around us?  
                    Cryptography, that's how!  Allow me to elaborate.  Everywhere you look, everywhere you go, people are trying to 
                    steal your personal information.  People you don't even know exist are trying to read the messages you send.  Your
                    life is too interesting to just put out there from anyone to see.  Cryptography allows you to encrypt your data into
                    an unreadable format to prevent unauthorized access.  Cryptography provides for secure and reliable communication
                    and data protection.  It's an essential tool for maintaining privacy, so use it liberally in all aspects of your life.
